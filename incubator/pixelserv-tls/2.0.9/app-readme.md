pixelserv-tls is a tiny bespoke HTTP/1.1 webserver with HTTPS and SNI support. It acts on behalf of hundreds of thousands of advert/tracker servers and responds to all requests with nothing to speed up web browsing.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/pixelserv-tls](https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/pixelserv-tls)
