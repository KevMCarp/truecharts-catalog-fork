MovieGrabber is a fully automated way of downloading movie from usenet, it supports any nzb client that has a "watched" or "monitor" folder facility such as Sabnzbd+, Grabit and Newsbin. MovieGrabber works by checking imdb for matching criteria and if a match is found the nzb will be downloaded and stored in either a specified queued folder for user review or sent to the watched folder for processing and automatic downloading via your usenet binary client.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/moviegrabber](https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/moviegrabber)
