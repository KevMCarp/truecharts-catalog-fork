description: MovieGrabber is a fully automated way of downloading movie from usenet, it supports any nzb client that has a "watched" or "monitor" folder facility such as Sabnzbd+, Grabit and Newsbin. MovieGrabber works by checking imdb for matching criteria and if a match is found the nzb will be downloaded and stored in either a specified queued folder for user review or sent to the watched folder for processing and automatic downloading via your usenet binary client.
