Ferdi is a destkop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdi gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage! Ferdi is compatible with your existing Franz account so you can continue right where you left off.

This App is supplied by TrueCharts, for more information visit the manual: [https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/ferdi-client](https://truecharts.org/charts/incubator/ferdi-client)
